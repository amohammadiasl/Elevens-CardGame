# Elevens Card Game
##### General Description:
This Java-based Elevens card game is a fun and challenging project. Elevens is a classic card game that tests your skills in matching cards to reach a sum of eleven. 
In this project, I've implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) and developed multiple objects to provide an engaging and interactive gaming experience.

##### Key Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game features an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows players to interact with the cards easily. <br>

Card Matching Challenge: Elevens is all about finding pairs of cards that add up to eleven. Cards with a face need to go in triples (Jack, King, and Queen) <br>

Multiple Object Implementation: To enhance the game's functionality and maintain clean code, I've structured the project using multiple objects and classes. This ensures a modular and organized approach to game development.<br>

Educational and Fun: Elevens is not just entertaining; it's an excellent way to exercise your brain. This project is perfect for students and card game enthusiasts looking for a unique learning experience.<br>
